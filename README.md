## Overview

PasteMax is a simple desktop app built for developers using AI coding assistants. It makes sharing your code with LLMs easy, thanks to a smart file explorer with token counting, file filtering, quick copy, and a previewer. Select the files you need, skip binaries and junk, and get clean, formatted snippets ready for your LLM.

cd pastemax
```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3. Build the app:

```
npm run build:electron
```

4. Package the app for your platform:
```
# For macOS

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm

### Running in Development Mode

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading for both the frontend and backend:

```
npm run dev:all
```

This will start the Vite dev server for the React app and the Electron main process concurrently.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```
# Build the React app with Vite and update paths for Electron
npm run build:electron

# Create platform-specific distributables
npm run package:mac    # macOS
npm run package:win    # Windows  
npm run package:linux  # Linux
```

## Project Structure

- **`src/`** - React application source code (Renderer Process)
  - `components/` - Reusable React components
  - `context/` - React context providers (e.g., ThemeContext)
  - `hooks/` - Custom React hooks for stateful logic
  - `types/` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `utils/` - Utility functions for the frontend
  - `styles/` - Modularized CSS stylesheets
- **`electron/`** - Electron-Backend related files (Main Process)
  - `main.js` - Main process entry point, window management, and IPC handling
  - `preload.js` - Preload script for secure IPC communication
  - `file-processor.js` - Logic for reading files, counting tokens, etc.
  - `ignore-manager.js` - Logic for handling `.gitignore` and other ignore patterns
  - `update-manager.js` - Logic for managing update checks
  - `watcher.js` - File system watcher logic using Chokidar
- **`public/`** - Static assets (e.g., icons)
- **`scripts/`** - Utility scripts for building, testing, and debugging

## Libraries Used

- **Electron** - Desktop application framework
- **React** & **TypeScript** - For building the user interface
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **Tiktoken** - Fast BPE tokenization for LLM context estimation
- **ignore** - For `.gitignore`-style pattern matching
- **Chokidar** - Advanced file system watcher

## Troubleshooting

### Getting "Warning: Not trusted" on Windows

If you see a warning about the app not being trusted, you can bypass this by clicking "More info" -> "Run anyway". This is a common issue with unsigned Electron apps.

### Getting "App can't be opened" on Mac

If you encounter this message on macOS, it may be due to security settings.
1. Right-click the `PasteMax.app` file and select "Open".
2. You may see a warning dialog. Click "Open" again to confirm.
You should only need to do this the first time you run the app.
