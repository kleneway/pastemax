## Overview

PasteMax is a simple desktop app built for developers using AI coding assistants. It makes sharing your code with LLMs easy, thanks to a smart file explorer with token counting, file filtering, quick copy, and a previewer. Select the files you need, skip binaries and junk, and get clean, formatted snippets ready for your LLM.

## Troubleshooting

### Getting "Warning: Not trusted" on Windows

If you see a warning about the app not being trusted, you can bypass this by clicking "run anyways". This is a common issue with Electron apps, especially since PasteMax is not signed.

### Getting "App not responding" on Mac

If you encounter an "App not responding" message on Mac, it may be due to macOS security settings. You can try the following:

1. Open System Preferences.
2. Go to Security & Privacy.
3. Under the General tab, look for the "Allow apps downloaded from" section.
4. Look for "PasteMax" and click "Open Anyway".
