# Revised Plan for Fixing .gitignore Hierarchy

This document outlines the revised plan for addressing issues with `.gitignore` handling, specifically focusing on improving pattern collection and hierarchical application of rules, as well as updating the `IgnorePatternsViewer.tsx` component to reflect these changes.

## 1. Problem Statement

The current implementation of `.gitignore` handling has several issues:

- The `collectGitignoreHierarchy` function incorrectly walks _up_ the directory tree instead of recursively scanning _downwards_.
- Patterns from subdirectories' `.gitignore` files aren't being applied with the correct relative context.
- The `IgnorePatternsViewer.tsx` component shows "0 patterns" even when `.gitignore` files exist.

## 2. Implementation Plan

### 2.1. Implement `collectGitignoreMapRecursive`

Replace `collectGitignoreHierarchy` with a new recursive scanning function that:

- Takes `startDir` and `rootDir` parameters
- Recursively scans _downwards_ from the starting directory
- Returns a `Map<string, string[]>` where:
  - Keys are directory paths (relative to root)
  - Values are arrays of patterns from that directory's `.gitignore`

### 2.2. Modify `loadGitignore`

Update the core ignore loading logic to:

1. Call `collectGitignoreMapRecursive(rootDir, rootDir)`
2. Process the returned `Map`:
   - For each `[relativeDirPath, patterns]` entry
   - Add patterns to the `ignore` instance with correct relative context
3. Update cache structure:
   - Store the collected map under `gitignoreMap` key
   - Remove old `gitignoreHierarchy` usage

### 2.3. Update IPC Handler

Modify the `get-ignore-patterns` handler to:

- Retrieve the cached `gitignoreMap` data
- Return it in the patterns object
- Remove temporary debugging/force-reload logic

### 2.4. Update Frontend Component

Update `IgnorePatternsViewer.tsx` to:

- Expect `gitignoreMap` in patterns prop
- Iterate over map entries to display sections
- Use relative paths for section titles/subtitles

## 3. Implementation Flow

    end
    H --> H3;
    H3 --> I[Cache { ig, patterns: {..., gitignoreMap: map} }];
    I --> D;
    D --> J[Use 'ig' Instance in readFilesRecursively];
    J --> K[End];

    L[UI Request: View Patterns] --> M(Call get-ignore-patterns Handler);
    M --> N[Ensure loadGitignore Ran (Cache Populated)];
    N --> O[Retrieve Cached Data { patterns: {..., gitignoreMap: map} }];
    O --> P[Return { patterns: {..., gitignoreMap: map} } to UI];
```

## 4. Testing Strategy

Test the implementation with various repository structures:

- No `.gitignore`
- Root `.gitignore` only
- `.gitignore` in subdirectories
- Nested subdirectories with `.gitignore` files
- Patterns with `/` prefix and `**` wildcards

Verify:

- Files are correctly included/excluded during scanning
- Viewer displays patterns from all levels correctly
- Performance with large repositories

# Handoff: Fixing Hierarchical .gitignore Handling

## 1. Problem Description

The application currently struggles to correctly handle `.gitignore` files in repositories with nested sub-repositories or complex directory structures containing multiple `.gitignore` files. Specifically:

- The ignore patterns collected might not respect the directory hierarchy as intended by Git.
- When viewing the applied ignore rules via the "View Ignore Patterns" modal (`IgnorePatternsViewer.tsx`), the "Repository Rules" section often shows "0 patterns" or is empty, even when `.gitignore` files exist and contain rules within the loaded project structure.
- Initial debugging indicated that the backend was returning an empty list for `.gitignore` rules (`gitignoreHierarchy: []`) to the frontend viewer.

## 2. Goal

The primary goal is to refactor the `.gitignore` processing logic to:

- Correctly identify and parse all relevant `.gitignore` files within the loaded project directory, respecting their hierarchical context (rules in subdirectories apply relative to that subdirectory).
- Accurately apply these hierarchical rules when filtering files during the directory scan (`readFilesRecursively`).
- Properly cache the collected hierarchical rules for performance.
- Display the collected hierarchical rules correctly in the `IgnorePatternsViewer` modal, showing which rules come from which `.gitignore` file (relative to the project root).

## 3. Approach Taken &amp; Current Status

1.  **Initial Plan (Discarded):** The first plan considered (`docs/plans/fix_gitignore_global.md`) involved transforming all patterns into global patterns. This was identified as incorrect for achieving true hierarchical gitignore behavior.
2.  **Revised Plan (Hierarchical):** A new plan was created (`docs/plans/fix-gitignore-hierarchy.md`) focusing on collecting patterns hierarchically and applying them relative to their origin directory.
3.  **Implementation Attempt 1 (`collectGitignoreHierarchy`):**
    - A function `collectGitignoreHierarchy` was implemented in `main.js` to collect patterns.
    - **Issue:** This function incorrectly walked _up_ the directory tree instead of recursively scanning _downwards_, resulting in it only finding `.gitignore` files in the immediate directory passed to it, not in subdirectories.
    - Debugging confirmed this function returned an empty hierarchy (`[]`) when called for the root directory, explaining the empty viewer.
4.  **Implementation Attempt 2 (`collectGitignoreMapRecursive` - In Progress):**
    - A new function `collectGitignoreMapRecursive` was designed to correctly scan _downwards_ recursively from a starting directory. It aims to return a `Map` where keys are directory paths and values are the patterns found in the `.gitignore` file within that directory.
    - **Current Blocker:** Attempts to replace `collectGitignoreHierarchy` with `collectGitignoreMapRecursive` in `main.js` using the `apply_diff` tool have repeatedly failed due to matching issues, even after reading the full file content. The next step was to attempt using `write_to_file` to overwrite `main.js` with the version containing the new function.

## 4. Next Steps (If Resuming Implementation)

1.  **Replace Collection Function:** Successfully replace `collectGitignoreHierarchy` with `collectGitignoreMapRecursive` in `main.js`. Using `write_to_file` with the complete intended content might be necessary if `apply_diff` continues to fail.
2.  **Update `loadGitignore`:** Modify `loadGitignore` in `main.js` to:
    - Call the new `collectGitignoreMapRecursive(rootDir, rootDir)` function.
    - Process the returned `Map`. For each entry (directory path -> patterns), calculate the relative path of the patterns _with respect to their directory_ and add them to the `ignore` instance (`ig`).
    - Store the collected `Map` in the cache under a key like `gitignoreMap` instead of `gitignoreHierarchy`.
3.  **Update `get-ignore-patterns` Handler:** Modify the IPC handler in `main.js` to:
    - Retrieve the cached data.
    - Return the `patterns` object containing the `gitignoreMap`.
    - Remove the temporary debugging/force-reload logic added previously.
4.  **Update `IgnorePatternsViewer.tsx`:** Modify the frontend component to:
    - Expect `patterns.gitignoreMap` (a Map) instead of `patterns.gitignoreHierarchy` (an array).
    - Iterate over the `gitignoreMap`. For each entry, display a separate `PatternSection` showing the patterns, using the Map key (directory path) to display the relative path in the section title/subtitle.
5.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the changes with various repository structures, including nested repositories and different `.gitignore` rule types, to ensure correctness and performance.
